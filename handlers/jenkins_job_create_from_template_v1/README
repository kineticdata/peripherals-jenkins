=== Detailed Description
Creates a new Jenkins job based on a provided template project on the same Jenkins server. To begin,
an XML representation of the template project is retrieved. The template substitutions are then
looped through and any text matching the substituion keys in the XML is replaced by the
corresponding value in the template substitutions map (NOTE: Because the replacement is run over
the whole config.xml file and not just the user input values, make sure to use strings that aren't
likely to be used in the system generation of the Jenkins XML file). Any Jenkins POST jobs need to
have a crumb to make a successful request, so before creation can happen a request to the server to
retrieve a Jenkins-Crumb needs to happen. Once that crumb is retrieved, it can be passed along as a
header and the job can be created with the modified config.xml. If the job was successfully created,
an empty result set will be returned.
